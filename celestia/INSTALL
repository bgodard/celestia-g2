Celestia Install instructions for UNIX
--------------------------------------

You need to have the following components installed before Celestia
will build: OpenGL (tested with Mesa 3.4), glut, libjpeg, and libpng.

Then, assuming you've collected all the necessary libraries, here's
what you need to do to build and run Celestia:

	configure
	make
	cp src/celestia .
	./celestia

The cp command should really be automatic, but I'm not quite there yet.  It's
very important run Celestia from the base directory in which it was unpacked;
otherwise, it won't find the configuration and data files.

This README included with this release is for the Windows version.  Not
every feature of the Window version of Celestia is supported yet.  There are
there are no menus right now, no mouse wheel support, and the arrow keys are
currently not working.  The only UNIX system I have available right now
is a P2-266 with RedHat 6.1 and no hardware 3D acceleration, which means that
Celestia is a slide show.  It's not too bad when there's nothing visible except
a star field, but once you get close to a planet or enable galaxies,
performance goes down the tubes.  I'm very interested in reports from users
with hardware acceleration.

Celestia Install instructions for UNIX
--------------------------------------

You need to have the following components installed before Celestia
will build: OpenGL (tested with Mesa 3.4), glut, libjpeg, and libpng.

Then, assuming you've collected all the necessary libraries, here's
what you need to do to build and run Celestia:

	configure
	make
	cp src/celestia .
	./celestia

The cp command should really be automatic, but I'm not quite there yet.  It's
very important run Celestia from the base directory in which it was unpacked;
otherwise, it won't find the configuration and data files.

There are two versions of Celestia which can be built--the default version
uses GLUT and has no GUI.  The other version uses Gtk+ to provide a basic
menu bar similar to the one in Celestia for Windows.  To build Celestia with
Gtk+ support, run configure with --enable-gtk:

	configure --enable-gtk

The GtkGLArea widget is required in order build Celestia with Gtk+.  It can
be downloaded from http://www.student.oulu.fi/~jlof/gtkglarea/

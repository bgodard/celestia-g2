Celestia Install instructions for UNIX
--------------------------------------

You need to have the following components installed before Celestia
will build: OpenGL (tested with Mesa 3.4), glut, libjpeg, and libpng.

Then, assuming you've collected all the necessary libraries, here's
what you need to do to build and run Celestia:

	configure
	make
	make install

There are two versions of Celestia which can be built--the default version
uses GLUT and has no GUI.  The other version uses Gtk+ to provide a basic
menu bar similar to the one in Celestia for Windows.  To build Celestia with
Gtk+ support, run configure with --enable-gtk:

	configure --enable-gtk

The GtkGLArea widget is required in order build Celestia with Gtk+.  It can
be downloaded from http://www.student.oulu.fi/~jlof/gtkglarea/

Celestia will be installed into /usr/local by default, with data files landing
in /usr/local/share/Celestia , but you may specify a new location with the
--prefix option to configure:

	configure --prefix=/home/my_directory

All the other usual configure parameters apply; you may see which options
are available using 'configure --help'

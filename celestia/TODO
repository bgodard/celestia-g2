Celestia To Do List
-------------------

USER INTERFACE
* More star label modes--nearest stars, brightest stars
* Add preferences for text color to config file
* Dialog box for displaying detailed information about a star or planet
* Star browser: flag stars with planetary systems
* Solar system browser: add icons
* Use a slider widget for controlling ambient light level
* Allow precise control of FOV

VISUALS
* Comets with dust and ion tails
* Render dark dust bands in galaxies
* Add textures to Mir model

POLISH
* Tutorial mode
* Preload some textures to avoid loading delay
* Make the demo loop
* Add a demo mode that visits random targets
* Compute accurate altitude above oblate planets/stars using point-to-ellipsoid
  distance function.

SIMULATION ACCURACY
* Fix apparent magnitude calculation for planets
* Model the chaotic rotation of Hyperion
* Account for the finite speed of light
* Use more intuitive/standard fields in galaxies file--instead of axis/angle
  orientations, use 'angle from face on' etc.

CODE
* Finish assert-ing the code

MISC
* Make solar system creation applet, for adding hypothetical systems to
  a Celestia universe
* Switch to UNICODE
* Internationalization

Celestia To Do List
-------------------

USER INTERFACE
* More star label modes--nearest stars, brightest stars
* Make picking more intelligent
  * Make picking more accurate for non-spherical bodies
  * Make galaxies pickable
* Views of planet and satellite orbits
  * Add satellite orbits
  * User control over which orbits should be displayed
* Next/prev body commands
* Add preferences for text color to config file
* Dialog box for displaying detailed information about a star or planet
* Create a manual
* Star browser: flag stars with planetary systems
* Solar system browser: add icons
* Popup H-R diagram window
* Use a slider widget for controlling ambient light level

VISUALS
* Shadows from rings on planet
* Get a real texture map for Eros
* Non-Lambertian illumination functions for planets
* Add haloes around bright planets similar to the ones around stars
* Comets with dust and ion tails
* Add some deep sky objects--planetary nebula, supernova remnants, etc.
* Procedural textures for extrasolar planets
* Bump mapped cloud layers
* Make atmospheres work for oblate planets
* Render galaxies with colors--bluish spiral arms, yellowish center
* Render dark dust bands in galaxies
* Add textures to ISS and Mir models

POLISH
* Tutorial mode
* Add a flashy intro screen
* Preload some textures to avoid loading delay
* Use Greek letters in Bayer designations
* Make the demo loop
* Add a demo mode that visits random targets
* Compute accurate altitude above oblate planets/stars using point-to-ellipsoid
  distance function.

SIMULATION ACCURACY
* Fix apparent magnitude calculation for planets
* Figure out a way to estimate gas giant's radius given its mass
* Obtain and read spacecraft ephemerii, so Galileo, Cassini, etc. appear in the proper places
* Use a better estimate for star radius
* Make some attempt at calculating stellar rotation rates
* Model the irregular rotations of objects like Toutatis and Hyperion
* Double star systems: make the stars actually orbit each other

BUGS
* Find out why picking sometimes stops working, apparently after orbiting (fixed?)
* Fix wobbling of planet shadow on rings when time is accelerated
* Investigate possible visual anomalies with ring shadows on ATI Rage cards

OPTIMIZATION
* Add option to force 16-bit textures
* Add low resolution texture package

CODE
* Make parser more robust (and fix that EOF problem)
* Change random printfs to DPRINTFs and Logs
* Finish assert-ing the code

PORTING
* Bring UNIX UI up to level of Windows UI
  * Implement solar system and star browsers
  * Context menus for both GLUT and Gtk versions
* MacOS port
* Make bump mapping and other GL extension stuff work under UNIX

MISC
* Create more powerful scripting system
* Make solar system creation applet, for adding hypothetical systems to
  a Celestia universe
* Allow lists of bodies from different .ssc files to be incorporated into
  the same planetary system
* Switch to UNICODE
* Internationalization

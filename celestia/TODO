Celestia To Do List
-------------------

USER INTERFACE
* More star label modes--nearest stars, brightest stars
* Add preferences for text color to config file
* Dialog box for displaying detailed information about a star or planet
* Star browser: flag stars with planetary systems
* Solar system browser: add icons
* Popup H-R diagram window
* Use a slider widget for controlling ambient light level
* Allow precise control of FOV

VISUALS
* Non-Lambertian illumination functions for planets
* Comets with dust and ion tails
* Bump mapped cloud layers
* Render dark dust bands in galaxies
* Add textures to Mir model
* Cloud shadows

POLISH
* Tutorial mode
* Preload some textures to avoid loading delay
* Make the demo loop
* Add a demo mode that visits random targets
* Compute accurate altitude above oblate planets/stars using point-to-ellipsoid
  distance function.
* Load add-ons from subdirectories of extras

SIMULATION ACCURACY
* Fix apparent magnitude calculation for planets
* Figure out a way to estimate gas giant's radius given its mass
* Model the chaotic rotation of Hyperion
* Account for the finite speed of light
* Use more intuitive/standard fields in galaxies file--instead of axis/angle
  orientations, use 'angle from face on' etc.
* Fix moon orbit bug: http://shatters.net/forum/posting.php?mode=reply&t=4966

BUGS
* Investigate possible visual anomalies with ring shadows on ATI Rage cards
* Fix slowdowns with ring shadows and night textures on ATI Rage cards

OPTIMIZATION
* Add option to force 16-bit textures

CODE
* Make parser more robust (and fix that EOF problem)
* Change random printfs to DPRINTFs and Logs
* Finish assert-ing the code

MISC
* Make solar system creation applet, for adding hypothetical systems to
  a Celestia universe
* Switch to UNICODE
* Internationalization

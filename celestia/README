Getting started:

Important:  Celestia must be started from the directory in which the EXE
resides or else it will not find its data files.  A real installer is
forthcoming.

Celestia will start up in a window, and if everything is working
correctly, you'll see the planet Neptune in front of a field of
stars.  In the left corner is a welcome message and some information
about your target (Neptune), your speed, and the current time (Universal
Time, so it'll probably be a few hours off from your computer's clock.)
Right drag the mouse to orbit Neptune and you should see other planets and
some familiar constellations.  Left dragging the mouse changes your
orientation too, but the camera rotates about its center instead of
rotating around Neptune.  Rolling the mouse wheel will change your distance
to the space station--you can move light years away, then roll the wheel
in the opposite direction to get back to your starting location.  If your
mouse lacks a wheel, you can use the Home and End keys instead.

In Celestia, you'll usually have some object selected; currently,
it's Neptune, but it could also be a star, planet, spacecraft, or galaxy.
The simplest way to select an object is to click on it.  Try clicking
on a star to select it.  The information about Eros is replaced with
some details about the star.  Press G (or use the navigation menu),
and you'll zoom through space toward the selected star.  If you
press G again, you'll approach the star even closer.

Press H to select our Sun, and then G to go back to our solar system.
You'll find yourself half a light year away from the sun, which looks
merely like a bright star at this range.  Press G three more times to
get within about 30 AU of the sun and you will be to see a few become
visible near the sun.  Right click on the sun to bring up a menu of
planets and other objects in the solar system.  After selecting a planet
from the menu, hit G again to travel toward it.  Once there, hold down
the right mouse button and drag to orbit the planet.

Tour Guide
The tour guide is a list of some of the more interesting objects you can visit
Celestia.  Select the Tour guide option in the navigation menu to bring up the
dialog box, select a destination from the list, click the Goto button, and
you're off.

That covers the very basics . . .


MOUSE FUNCTIONS:

Left drag to orient camera
Right drag to orbit the selected object
Use the mouse wheel to adjust distance to selection
    (for wheelless mice, dragging while holding left and right
    buttons or left dragfing while holding control to dolly camera
    will adjust distance)
Left drag while holding shift to zoom
Click the wheel to reset the field of view to 45 degrees
Left-click to select; double click to center selection
Right-click to bring up context menu

Star and Planet Browsers:
[For the moment This only applies to the Windows version of Celestia.]
In the navigation menu are 'Solar System Browser' and 'Star Browser'
options.  The Solar System Browser pops up a window with a tree view
of all the objects in the nearest solar system (if there is one at all
within a light year of your current position.)  Clicking on the name
of any planet in the window will select it; you can then use the center
or goto buttons to see it in the main Celestia window.  The star
browser is a window showing a table of the hundred nearest stars,
along with their distances and apparent and absolute magnitudes. 
Clicking on the column headers will sort the stars.  The table is
not continuously updated--if you travel to another star, you should
press the Refresh button to update the table for your current position.
The radio buttons beneath the table let you switch between viewing
a list of nearest or brightest stars.  As with the solar system browser,
clicking on any star name in the table will select it--use this feature
along with the center button to tour the stars visible from any night
sky in the galaxy.

Selecting Objects by Name:
It's possible to choose a star or planet by name.  There are two ways to
enter a star name: choose 'Select Object' from the Navigation menu to
bring up a dialog box, or by hitting Enter, typing in the name, and
pressing Enter again.  You can use common names, or Bayer designations
and HD catalog numbers for stars.  Bayer and Flamsteed designations need
to be entered like this:
      Upsilon And
      51 Peg 
The constellation must be given as a three letter abbreviation and the
full Greek letter name spelled out.  Irritating, but it'll be fixed.
HD catalog numbers must be entered with a space between HD and the number.

Celestia handles star catalog numbers in a slightly kludgy way.  To keep the
star database size to minimum, only one catalog number is stored.  Normally,
this will a number from the HD catalog, but if a star isn't in the HD catalog
the number from another catalog will be used instead.  Currently, the secondary
catalog is always the HIPPARCOS data set, for which the prefix "HIP" should be
used.


Basic Hacking Tips:

It's possible to modify the solarsys.ssc, stars.dat, and hdnames.dat
files to create an entirely fictional universe.

The easiest file to modify is the solar system catalog, as it's a text
file and the format is very text-editor friendly since that's how I
had to enter all the data.  It's also quite verbose, but that's not a
problem yet.

The units used for the solar system data may not be obvious.  All
angle fields in the catalog are in degrees.  For planets, the period
is specified in earth years, and the semi-major axis in AU; for
satellites, days and kilometers are used instead.

All solar system textures should be placed in the textures
subdirectory.  Currently, JPEG and BMP are the only formats supported.
Models belong in the models directory.  Celestia can read 3DS models,
as well as a custom format (.cms files, used right now just for rough
fractal displacement map likenesses of asteroids and small moons.)  3DS
meshes are normalized to fit within a unit cube--the Radius field
determines how big they appear within Celestia.

The stars.dat file is a binary database of stars, processed from
the 50+ meg HIPPARCOS data set.  The first four bytes are an int
containing the number of stars in the database.  Following that
are a bunch of records of this form:

4 byte int   : catalog number
4 byte float : right ascension
4 byte float : declination
4 byte float : parallax
2 byte int   : apparent magnitude
2 byte int   : stellar class
1 byte       : parallax error

RA, declination, and parallax are converted to x, y, z coordinates
and apparent magnitude is converted to absolute magnitude when the
database is read.

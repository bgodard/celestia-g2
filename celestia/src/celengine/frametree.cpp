/* A FrameTree is hierarchy of solar system bodies organized according to
 * the relationship of their reference frames. An object will appear in as a child
 * in the tree of whatever object is the center of its orbit frame.
 * Since an object may have several orbit frames in its timeline, the
 * structure is a bit more complicated than a straightforward tree
 * of Body objects. A Body has exactly a single parent in the frame tree
 * at a given time, but may have many over it's lifespan. An object's
 * timeline contains a list of timeline phases; each phase can point to
 * a different parent. Thus, the timeline can be thought of as a list of
 * parents.

	Target "Sol/Jupiter"
	Description "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and the fifth from the sun.  Like the other large outer planets, Jupiter is a gas giant, with no solid surface.  The Great Red Spot is the biggest and longest-lived of the many storms in Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere; this Earth-sized tempest has been around for at least 300 years."

{
	Name "에로스"
	Target "Sol/Eros"
	Description "Eros is a potato-shaped near-Earth asteroid about 33 km long.  Thanks to the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft, more is known about Eros than any other Asteroid.  On Feb 14, 2001 NEAR descended on Eros and became the first spacecraft ever to land on an asteroid."

	Target "63 Tau"
	Distance 25
	DistanceUnits "ly"
	Description "Named for the five daughters of Atlas and Aethra, the Hyades is one of the most prominent open star clusters in the sky.  It is estimated that the stars of the Hyades are approximately 660 million years old--over six times older than the hotter, bluer Pleiades stars which appear nearby in our night sky."

	Target "Sol/Ida"
	Distance 200
	DistanceUnits "km"
	Description "The Galileo spacecraft photographed the asteroid 243 Ida in 1993 on its way to Jupiter.  These pictures revealed that Ida had a tiny satellite that was later named Dactyl.  Several other asteroids have since been discovered also to have satellites."

{
	Name "페가수스 자리 51번항성 b"
	Target "51 Peg/b"
	Description "51 Pegasi b was the first planet discovered orbiting a normal star other than our Sun.  It is a gas giant planet and orbits extremely close to its parent star--less than one fifth the distance between Mercury and our sun.  That a gas giant could exist so close to a star has forced astronomers to seriously revise their theories of solar system formation."

{
	Name "알비레오"
	Target "Albireo"
	Distance 0.6
	Description "Because of the contrasting orange and blue-white colors of its component stars, the Albireo double star system is considered one of the most beautiful pairs in the sky.  The orange star is a Type K giant, and its companion is a B dwarf."

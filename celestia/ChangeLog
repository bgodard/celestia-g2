* Some configuration parameters now read from a file
* Support for multiple solar system catalog files
* Split solar system files into solarsys.ssc and extrasolar.ssc
* Added Help/License menu
* Added simple camera orbit mode
* Fixed up parsing and printing of catalog numbers--still kludgy though


1.02
* Made Celestia icon appear in corner of window.  Whee.
* Fixed an extremely subtle numerical precision bug which manifested itself in
  a number of ways:  jittering when following small objects, incorrect
  targeting of small objects with goto, occasional flashes when closely
  approaching an object, and probably other things as well.
* Reversed rotation directions when orbiting--it's much more intuitive now
* Added an exponential dolly capability to the camera
* Double-clicking will now center on the selected object
* Fixed bug in elliptical orbit calculation
* When orbits are displayed, the Orbit for the selected object is highlighted
* Incorporated Scott Hudson's asteroid geometry data for Toutatis, Kleopatra,
  and Geographos.
* Fixed problems with disappearing labels and with misplaced labels for
  extrasolar planets
* Eliminated 'sticking' when mouse buttons released outside of Celestia window

1.03
* Rotating the camera is now more responsive to mouse movement
* 'Infinite mouse' hack allows rotating and dollying without having to pick up
  the mouse and reposition the cursor in the window

  as points.  Small satellites will no longer get obscured by planets they're
  in front of.
* Apparent magnitude calculation for planets now takes into account phase
* At close range, stars are now rendered as textured sphere meshes.
* Choosing stars by catalog number no longer selects a star even when the specified
  star doesn't exist.
* Added labels for stars; the list of labelled stars is read from celestia.cfg
* Cleaned up vecmath.h, added consts and reference parameters where appropriate
* Cleaned up StarNameDatabase


1.04
* Start out at the moon instead of in deep space
* Made picking of planets work properly for planets with disc sizes greater than one
  pixel.

  reality.

   - <= 4 alternate names, 
   - info-URLs, 
   - absolute magnitudes and 
   - correct sizes & orientations in space, as calculated from catalog
     parameters. 
* Included well commented Perl script (deepsky.pl) as documentation. The used distance determination method is indicated in catalog for each galaxy.
* Updated binary star data base (visualbins.stc, spectbins.dsc) and respective
  PERL catalog extraction scripts (visualbins.pl, spectbins.pl), such as to eliminate double occurences wrto nearstars.stc (, which remained unaffected).
* Added much improved galaxy templates.
* Implemented galaxy coloration based on hue profiles from true color
  photographic imaging. Being older than spirals, elliptical galaxies have a somewhat redder coloration.
* Implemented a realistic relative apparent brightness display scheme for
  galaxies.

* Added display of DSO Type (Galaxy,...) and Hubble subtype in case of
  galaxies.

  visibility.
* Did extensive octree rebuilding. Culling of deep sky objects is logarithmic
  now, enabling support for very large catalogs with little performance expenses.
* Performed optimized tuning of octree parameters that practically recovers
  the "pre-galactic" performance, despite a large data base of 10610 galaxies.
* Added support for multiple names of deep sky objects and implemented
  non linear keyboard selection of names with corresponding tab completion, etc., like with the rest of the celestial bodies.
* Replaced deep sky catalog class with a more complex database, following the
  original star database layout. This allows for more sophisticated and fast treatment of massive catalogs.
* Enabled very fast search of close-to-viewer deep sky objects.
* Implemented brightness corrections involving the angle between 1-2 surface
  normals and the viewing angle, such that the brightness distribution
  gets ~ uniform  for all galaxy orientations and Hubble types. This also

  realistic human eye sensitivity profile.
* Brightness display optionally coupled with Automag scheme.
* Enabled very fast picking of deep sky objects.
* Placed galaxy templates in 'models/' directory.
* Added various crucial fixes in galaxy.cpp,
   - factor 2 was missing in the 'size' definition via the radius such that
     distances among DSO's were grossly incorrect;
   - fixed correct ordering of (non-commuting) operations in matrix m.
     This gave incorrect galaxy orientations;
   - To save space and to improve display: generate neat spherical E0
     template from S0 disk template via rescaling by (1.0f, 3.8f, 1.0f);
   - fixed wrong x,y alignment of elliptical rescaling.
* Added code to ease compilation with newer Xcode versions (Macintosh).
* Updated src/celengine/Makefile.am for Linux building. 
* Introduced a new cel function => renderflags {set "nebulae"}.
* Reduced the default value of 'faintestAutoMag45deg' from 8.5 to 7.0.
* Fixed the visibility of the Milky Way during day-time and the abrupt
  appearance or disappearance of galaxies near the day-night border.
* Enabled "geosynchronous Follow" (key 'Y') also for selected DSO's
  (yet it does not seem to be very useful...).
* Moved render flag check in the code such that labels can be drawn even if
  e.g. renderGalaxy flag is turned off.
* Suppressed apparent magnitude display for galaxy add-ons, lacking
  specification of an absolute magnitude (absMag) input value.
* Deleted various source code files that became superfluous.
* Improved comet display. Introduced a neat scheme implementing comet tail
  fading (between 4 and 6 AU for Sol). Systems with several suns and
  luminosities different from the solar one are accounted for. 
* Implemented a new, simple scheme avoiding overcrowded galaxy labels.  
  Their "importance"  is sorted according to apparent magnitude! Thus the
  labels of the brightest galaxies pop up first upon zooming in... 
* Fixes/workarounds for OpenGL 2.0 render paths on both nVidia and ATI cards.

Celestia Revision History
-------------------------

1.00
* Initial public release


1.01
* Added more realistic and aesthetically pleasing ring illumination function
* Made planets project shadows onto their rings (requires multitexturing)
* Detect and use ARB_multitexture extension
* Some configuration parameters now read from a file
* Support for multiple solar system catalog files
* Split solar system files into solarsys.ssc and extrasolar.ssc
* Added Help/License menu
* Added simple camera orbit mode
* Fixed up parsing and printing of catalog numbers--still kludgy though


1.02
* Made Celestia icon appear in corner of window.  Whee.
* Fixed an extremely subtle numerical precision bug which manifested itself in
  a number of ways:  jittering when following small objects, incorrect
  targeting of small objects with goto, occasional flashes when closely
  approaching an object, and probably other things as well.
* Reversed rotation directions when orbiting--it's much more intuitive now
* Added an exponential dolly capability to the camera
* Double-clicking will now center on the selected object
* Fixed bug in elliptical orbit calculation
* When orbits are displayed, the Orbit for the selected object is highlighted
* Incorporated Scott Hudson's asteroid geometry data for Toutatis, Kleopatra,
  and Geographos.
* Fixed problems with disappearing labels and with misplaced labels for
  extrasolar planets
* Eliminated 'sticking' when mouse buttons released outside of Celestia window
* Added Real Time option to Time menu
* Reversed planet rotation direction so it's correct.  Oops.
* Added about a dozen extrasolar systems from Jean Schneider's catalog
* Create two new textures for extrasolar planets
* Moved Selection class outside of Simulation, as it's generally useful


1.03
* Rotating the camera is now more responsive to mouse movement
* 'Infinite mouse' hack allows rotating and dollying without having to pick up
  the mouse and reposition the cursor in the window
* Fixed z ordering for planets and satellites so small that they only appear
  as points.  Small satellites will no longer get obscured by planets they're
  in front of.
* Apparent magnitude calculation for planets now takes into account phase
* At close range, stars are now rendered as textured sphere meshes.
* Choosing stars by catalog number no longer selects a star even when the specified
  star doesn't exist.
* Added labels for stars; the list of labelled stars is read from celestia.cfg
* Cleaned up vecmath.h, added consts and reference parameters where appropriate
* Cleaned up StarNameDatabase


1.04
* Start out at the moon instead of in deep space
* Made picking of planets work properly for planets with disc sizes greater than one
  pixel.
* Added call to glDeleteTextures to Texture class destructor
* Added bump mapping.  Uses DOT3 bump mapping and only works on GeForce cards
  right now.

* Added 3DS models of Deimos, Phobos, and numerous other asteroids and
  small moons based on Phil Stooke's models
* Replaced TriangleList class with much more flexible VertexList
* Introduced support for compressed textures; texture compression is specified
  on a per texture basis in .ssc files.
* Added a reverse time option
* Added an OpenGL Driver Info item to the help menu


1.05
* Made per-pixel lighting work for planets without bump maps too
* Allow user control of magnitude of faintest visible stars
* Added support for PNG textures

  coordinates.
* Eliminated case sensitivity when selecting objects by name
* New ring texture for Saturn with separate reflectance and opacity
* Ring textures now specified in .ssc files instead of hardcoded
* Implemented date/time selector dialog box
* Changed the mouse wheel function from zoom to dolly.  Zoom is now controlled by
  shift left-dragging the mouse.  For mice without wheels, control left-dragging
  will dolly.
* Fixed orbit and dolly functions to work in follow mode
* Improved rendering of objects at close range: less clipping, extra sphere LOD.
* Fixed bug that caused irregular objects to be displayed at half their actual size
* ESC now cancels goto and follow instead of exiting app.
* Fixed orbital calculations for planets so their positions are now closer to
  reality.
* Completed extrasolar planets database; it now contains all known planets
  around normal stars
* Mir!
* MeanAnomaly field in .ssc files was incorrectly called TrueAnomaly; this
  is fixed, and solar system parser now also accepts MeanLongitude in orbital
  elements section.
* Epoch can now be specified for orbital elements.  Default is J2000.


1.06
* Made Alt+F4 exit the app.
* Fixed text rendering to be pixel-accurate; labels and console text are now
  crisper and don't have any missing pixels (need to test on more graphics
  chipsets.)

* Added extrasolar planets from the ESO's April 4th announcement

  sky due to this bug.)

  the quality of rendering with 16-bit z buffers
* Added option to render constellation diagrams
* Use strips instead of lists for rendering spheres

* Constrained parallaxes of stars which are components of multistar systems;
  binary stars now actually close to each other and not just when viewed
  from Earth.
